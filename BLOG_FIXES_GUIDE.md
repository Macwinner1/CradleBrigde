## üîç Debugging Tips

### If Editing Still Doesn't Work

1. **Open browser console** (F12)
2. Click **"Edit"** on a post
3. Check console for errors
4. Look for: `Editing post: {post data}`
5. Verify all fields populate

**Console Output Should Show:**
```
Editing post: {id: "123", title: "...", content: "..."}
```

### If Image Upload Fails

1. **Check console** for specific error
2. **Verify Firebase Storage** is configured:
   - Check `.env` file has `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
   - Verify bucket name is correct
3. **Check image file:**
   - Is it under 5MB?
   - Is it JPG/PNG/GIF?
   - Does filename have special characters?

**Console Output Should Show:**
```
Uploading image: blog/1234567890_photo.jpg
Image uploaded successfully: https://firebasestorage...
```

### If Creating is Still Slow

1. **Check network speed** - Slow internet affects upload
2. **Check image size** - Large images take longer
3. **Watch console** for bottlenecks:

**Fast Creation (no image):**
```
Saving post data: {title, content...}
Creating new post
Create response: {success: true}
‚úÖ Blog post created successfully
Time: < 1 second
```

**With Image:**
```
Starting image upload...
Uploading image: blog/...
Image upload complete: https://...
Saving post data: {...}
‚úÖ Blog post created successfully
Time: 2-4 seconds
```
