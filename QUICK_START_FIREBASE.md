## üîß Troubleshooting

### Firebase Login Not Working
**Problem:** Can't login to admin
**Solution:**
- Check Firebase credentials in `frontend/.env`
- Verify you created an admin user in Firebase Console
- Make sure Email/Password authentication is enabled in Firebase
- Check browser console for errors

### Backend Not Responding
**Problem:** API calls failing
**Solution:**
- Check backend is running on port 5000
- Check terminal for errors
- Verify `frontend/.env` has `REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api`

### CORS Errors
**Problem:** Cross-origin errors in browser
**Solution:**
- Make sure backend is running
- Check `backend/.env` has `FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000`
- Restart both servers

### Applications Not Showing
**Problem:** Submitted applications don't appear in dashboard
**Solution:**
- Make sure you're logged in as admin
- Check backend terminal for errors
- Note: Data is in-memory, so it's lost when backend restarts

## üìù Important Notes

### Development Mode
- **Data Storage:** Currently using in-memory storage (arrays)
- **What this means:** All data is lost when you restart the backend server
- **For Production:** You'll need to set up a database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)

### Firebase Admin SDK (Optional for Development)
- The backend works without Firebase Admin SDK credentials in development
- For production, you should add Firebase Admin credentials to `backend/.env`
- See `FIREBASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions

### Security
- Current setup is secure for development
- For production, follow the security checklist in `INTEGRATION_STATUS.md`

## üöÄ Next Steps After Firebase Setup

1. **Test All Features:**
   - Submit applications
   - Submit contact forms
   - View blog posts
   - Manage data in admin dashboard

2. **Customize Content:**
   - Update school information in pages
   - Add real blog posts
   - Update contact information

3. **Set Up Email Notifications:**
   - Follow the EmailJS setup above

4. **Prepare for Production:**
   - Set up a database (MongoDB recommended)
   - Configure Firebase Admin SDK
   - Set up hosting (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
